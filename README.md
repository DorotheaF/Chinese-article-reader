# Chinese-article-reader

A windows application intended to help students of Chinese read unfamilar text. User uploads Chinese text, the program processes and stores it in the article directory. The user opens the file from the directory and can interact with the article by clicking on a word and seeing the definition. They can also add words to vocab lists, and customize definitions and known words.

Future features include difficulty grading, a new vocab print out for an article (lists all unfamiliar words in order of appearance, for to facilitate reading), and implementation of the file upload system.

The current UI is very basic and will be updated when the core functionality is completed.
